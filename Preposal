## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I would like to utilize turtle functions because I think they can be well utilized in loops and functions which will show my
coding ability, and I quite enjoy using them. My idea is to create a somewhat interactive comic strip. I can make a short story
about a turtle drawn character (stick figure of sorts with animation) that can respond to user inputs. If it is not possible
to have user inputs on the same turtle screen, and only able to do that before hand then all of the user prompts will come up
at the start. These user prompts can include a choices on what type of character should be displayed (male, female, blonde, 
brunette, tall short, etc.) and what repond the character will do, i.e. decisions the character will make when faced with
obstacles. Or it can be as simple as the character walking vs. running. vs jumping. etc. Not sure how advanced it needs to be.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Solo

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Aside from complexity desired, I am curious if the same turtle screen can have new inputs after it draws a figure?
